        <h1> Your hair shouldn't define who you are.</h1>
        <h2> These are some inspirational and helpful resources I read during the time I was going through a hard time accepting my natutral hair.</h2>
        <h2> Hope you get inspired too :) </h2>
        <p> Online was where I found myself mostly inspired. <i> Essence</i> is the magazine where I found all my hair products, hairstyles, beautiful black women, etc. Essence is all about focusing on reaching an audience of black women. The magazine covers fashion,lifestyle, and beauty tips for women of color.
        </p>
        <p> Essence became my all time favorite magazines for hair tips because of all the beautiful versatility in different hair types, textures, and how to love your hair. They would include famous celebrties ranging from a young age and above. About how these girls and women rocked their curls no matter the type. Essence included hair produtcs and tricks that I have followed and go by.</p>

        <p> I watched many insipirational videos on black hair and how it has evolved over the many years and why certain choises were made about black women not accepting their natural hair In this video they show why many women of color didn't accept their hair and how over time many motivational women changed that and motivated us young women to accept our hair..</p>
