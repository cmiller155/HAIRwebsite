        <h2> Hair is just hair.</h2>
        <p> As a child I loved my big curly coily hair. I loved the way it felt, how big it could get when it was blowed dried or how much it shrinked when it was wet. Fast forward to middle school and high school days: I barely saw any girls with hair like me. I got stared at "How come her hair is so different than ours?" "Why is it <i>puffy</i>?" I would get home and tell my mom I wanted to straighten my hair to look like the girls in my school. I wanted pretty, sleek, straight hair like all of them. Since my mom already spent a lot of time taking care of my hair, she thought - ok, why not? I started to feel like I could finally fit in and get compliments on being pretty too since that's what boys liked - the girls with the pretty, straight long hair. I also did this all to not be stared at and get asked many questions. I did it to fit in and feel good about going to school everyday knowing I looked presentable. </p>
    
        <p>Afterwards, my aunt would come visit and realized my natural hair was starting to get damaged and get very weak and brittle. That's when braids came in. Of course I had already done braids before as a child and I never thought twice about it. Until I came to school and some girls asked me "OMG how is your hair so long now? is that real? where did you get that hair? You look like you're growing a cornmaze on your head." Meaning I had cornrows done that day, I completely shut down. I came home crying, begging my mom not to make me do braids, told her that kids made fun of me for having fake hair, and that I looked ugly with it. I grew such a hate for braids my whole middle school and high school days!Until my aunt suggested it again...</p>
        
        <p>I started to read blogs, stories,magazines,etc. That inspired me to love my natural hair, and not feel alone. Many other women have gone through what I have. Many powerful and inspirational women such as Rihanna and Gabrielle Chanel changed me and my views of myself in a positive way. The way they put themselves out there and inspire young girls like me get affected by society thoughts/ opinions on how we should look. These women would say how we shouldn't care what others think of us. We're allowed to do whatever we want. " <i> I don't care what you think about me, I don't think about you at all." - Coco Chanel</i> That's when I started to gain more self confidence,find my happiness, be happy with my hair, and love myself. Going through this experience not only did it made me stronger but it also made me gain more knowledge on how to love my hair and be my true best self. </p>
